	<h2>HTML</h2>
	<p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is <strong>the standard markup language</strong> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
	It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets <u>(CSS)</u> and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
	Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
	HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
	</p>
	<p>
	HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
